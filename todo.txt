Needs to be done:
    Add low complexity check for primers (low complexity between primers?)
    Update dimerisation methods to use recursion +/ hamming distance function


Things that could be done:
    FastaDNA:
        Generate the forward and the reverse strand in just one loop
            Reverse, just add opposing base and biold from the back instead

        Could ignore the reverse strand

    Trie
        Could change result in hamming distance to bool instead of list

    Candidate_Primers:
        First goes through entire genome to remove GCC, then again to apply filters
        apply_Filters goes through both forward and reverse strand, does not look very good
        Implement a way of applying just a few filters without going through entire genome multiple times
