Identify "unique primers"
    Analyze differences in Annealing Temperature
    Find similar primers and calculate binding temp. compare to perfect fit. Want at least deltaT 10 deg
        A, T = 2 deg
        C, G = 4 deg

Selection criteria for "unique":
    Minimum Annealing temp. OR length of PCR primer
    Minimum allowed deltaT


Possible approaches:
    1.
        Idea:
            Go through the genome and identify all primers
            Store "unique" primers somewhere, remove if they are found

        Algorithm:
            read genome(f, r)
            for each "primer" in genome:
                add "primer" to Trie

                if "primer" not in Trie:
                    add "primer" to UniqueList
                else:
                    remove "primer" from UniqueList

            for each "primer" in UniqueList:
                Calculate dT
                if "primer".dT < min:
                    remove "primer" from UniqueList
                else:
                    keep "primer"

        Notes on algorithm:
            How to decide what "primer is?"
            Use UniqueList or something else???
                Use Set, other Trie or something else to store?
            How to label if "primer" is from f or r?
            How to calculate dT?
